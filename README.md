## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to deploy a JSON Server using Render's web service. JSON Server allows you to create a full fake REST API with zero coding in less than 30 seconds, ideal for front-end developers who need a quick back-end solution for prototyping.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KumarDeepak16/Render-json-server.git
cd your-repo-name
npm install
```

## Usage

### Running Locally

To run the JSON server locally on your machine:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will start the JSON Server on `http://localhost:3000`. You can edit the `db.json` file to modify the data.

### Deploying to Render

1. Create a new web service on [Render](https://render.com/) and connect it to your GitHub repository.
2. Set the build and start commands in Render:

   - **Build Command:** `npm install`
   - **Start Command:** `npm run start`

3. Deploy the service, and Render will automatically start your JSON server.

The API will be accessible at `https://your-service-name.onrender.com`.

## API Endpoints

Here are some example endpoints you can use:

- `GET /items` - Get all items
- `GET /items/:id` - Get a single item by ID
- `POST /items` - Add a new item
- `PUT /items/:id` - Update an item by ID
- `DELETE /items/:id` - Delete an item by ID

You can customize the endpoints by modifying the `db.json` file.
